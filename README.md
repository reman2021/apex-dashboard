## Features

### 🗒️ Memo
Capture thoughts instantly with a built-in memo pad. Each memo card has a writable textarea — jot down ideas, meeting notes, or daily reflections without leaving your dashboard. Supports `[[wikilinks]]` that render as clickable links.

### ✅ Todo
Manage tasks with interactive checklists. Add, reorder, drag-and-drop, and check off tasks. A progress bar shows completion percentage at a glance. Todo items also support `[[wikilinks]]` for cross-referencing notes.

### 📁 Projects
Organize your vault documents into project cards. Each card links to related notes, displays a cover image (supports both local vault images and web URLs), and supports inline document search to add new files quickly. Manage multiple file types including Markdown notes, PDFs, images, audio, and video.

### 📝 Notes
A compact, list-style section for organizing reference documents and quick-access files. Displays up to 5 cards per row without cover images for maximum density.

### ⚡ Quick Actions
Pin your most-used shortcuts to the sidebar. Supports two action types: **File** links to open any document, and **Command** shortcuts to trigger any Obsidian command. Includes built-in presets for New Journal and New Note.

### 🌤️ Sidebar Widgets
The left sidebar features decorative widgets for at-a-glance information:

- **Week Calendar** — A compact 7-day strip highlighting today's date
- **Weather Widget** — Real-time weather with current temperature, feels-like, humidity, wind speed, and a 5-day forecast with daily high/low temperatures. Powered by Open-Meteo (no API key needed). City search with geocoding autocomplete for precise location
- **Heatmap Widget** — Track daily frontmatter data (mood, sleep, etc.) as a GitHub-style contribution heatmap. Configurable summary: streak days (⚡), completion rate (✅), or both
- **Pomodoro Timer** — A focus timer with activity selector and session tracking. Start, pause, and stop timed sessions with a donut chart showing today's breakdown by activity
- **Currently Reading** — Track your reading sessions with a built-in timer. Add book information manually, time your reading sessions, and record progress with page numbers. Each book card shows cover image, author, and reading progress bar
- **Day Counter** — Up to three compact day counters for important target dates, displayed by days remaining

### 🗃️ Library
Create database-like sections from your vault notes. Filter by explicit frontmatter properties, select matching property values as chips, group Kanban cards by a property, and switch between grid, list, table, and Kanban views.

### 🎨 Banner
A customizable banner with an inspirational quote, optional author, quote color, external quote library, and background image list. Quote library entries can include authors, and multiple background images rotate automatically. Supports both local vault images and web URLs. Double-click to edit.

### 🔄 Drag & Drop
Drag task items within Todo cards to reorder. Drag document links between project/note cards.

### 🧩 Custom Sections
Create sections with built-in types — **Memo**, **Todo**, **Projects**, **Notes**, **Dashboard**, and **Library** — each with its own layout and behavior. Mix and match to fit your workflow.

### 🕐 Recent Documents
The sidebar shows recently edited files with relative timestamps, so you can jump back into your latest work.

## Installation

### Manual Installation
1. Download or build this fork.
2. Copy `main.js`, `styles.css`, and `manifest.json` into your vault's `.obsidian/plugins/apex-dashboard/` folder.
3. Open Settings > Community Plugins and enable "Apex Dashboard".

## Usage

1. Open the dashboard via the ribbon icon (home icon) or command palette: `Apex Dashboard: Open dashboard`
2. A `dashboard.md` file is automatically created in your vault root
3. All changes are saved directly to the file — it's your data, in plain text

Common workflows:

- Edit the banner to set a quote, optional author, quote color, quote library path, and one or more background images.
- Use Todo card actions to archive completed or inactive cards. Archived cards keep their archive date and can be restored from the archived-card list.
- Open Day Counter settings from the sidebar widget, add up to three target dates, and pick dates from the calendar popup.
- Use Currently Reading to manually enter book information, then track reading sessions and page progress.
- Configure Library sections by selecting explicit frontmatter properties and choosing existing property values as filters.

> **Note:** Deleting, renaming, or reordering sections must be done by editing the `dashboard.md` file directly. Any changes made to the note will take effect in the dashboard view immediately.
